ahmed<b>Why does the application show a compilation error? Doesn't it support for, while, if or /some other language feature here/?</b><br/>
The app uses the Roslyn compiler - C# 11 compilation support.<br/>
Any compilation related error encountered is probably a syntax or logic error in your own code and thefore only adressable by you.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support GUI?</b><br/>
Yes, .NET MAUI.<br/> However currently the app doesn't support generating Java peers and Android resources. This means that if you write a new class inheriting Java.Lang.Object, directly or not won't have the Java part required and will throw an Exception.
<br/>
<b>Does the app support Windows.Forms?</b><br/>
No. Android OS != Windows.<br/>
It is impossible for Android to support Windows.Forms due to extreme incompatibility issues (no touch, no applicable mapping for most controls, incompatable layouts and heavy dependency on Windows API)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why can't I close file/project?</b><br/>
Redundant operation. Current file and/or project is closed automatically when you open or create a new one.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why was the application closed when when returning to foreground after a while?</b><br/>
It is a RAM intensive app. Other RAM intensive apps you use (like a web browser) will cause the system to kill resource consuming background processes like C# Shell when your RAM gets low.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support NuGet packages?</b><br/>
Yes. However, anything containing library dependencies that aren't .NET/C# won't work. Including Android bindings, at least for now.<br/>
Native .so (C++) libraries are included when you build an APK.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support databases?</b><br/>
In general, yes. However a full ORM like Entity might not be properly supported unless you stick to SQLite.<br/>
Note that you would need to use <font color='green'>Xamarin.MySql.Data</font> instead of <font color='red'>MySql.Data</font>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support scripts?</b><br/>
No, that might be confusing for people who aren't yet familiar with the C# language.<br/>
However since it is now a language feature it does support top level statements, which is practically identical for simple code.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support creating class or page/xaml files?</b><br/>
Yes, from the "..." folder dropdowns in the left project menu. It doesn't support automatically making classes in an already existing file, since that is the same (or slower) as typing it somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Can I reference a ".dll" file?</b><br/>
Yes, from the "..." menu in the left project menu's assembly references section.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Does the app support external keyboards?</b><br/>
Yes. Including a few custom shortcuts (see settings).<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to fix "You need to declare the permission..." ?</b><br/>
You need to declare it from the "APK project settings" and then export as APK.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Is the app free?</b><br/>
Yes, mostly. The non premium version shows a banner ad when the keyboard is closed and sometimes a popup ad when exporting APK.<br/>
The only features locked out by premium are realtime code errors, cloud sync and the MAUI XAML designer.<br/>
